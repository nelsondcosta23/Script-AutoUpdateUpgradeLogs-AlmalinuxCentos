## ðŸ”„ AutoUpdate & Notification Script for AlmaLinux

Keep your server healthy, updated, and under control â€” effortlessly.

This script checks for system updates, applies them when needed, logs everything neatly, and emails you a full report â€” whether updates were installed, skipped, or if something failed. It even reboots the system **only when necessary**, and always after emailing you first.

No more logging in just to run `dnf update`. Automate it, track it, and stay informed â€” with style.

Perfect for sysadmins who love clean logs, smart automation, and peace of mind.

Give permission to the .msmtprc file:
```bash

```bash
echo -e "To: your_email@example.com\nFrom: noreply@demo.com\nSubject: MSMTP Test\n\nThis is a test email." | msmtp --debug your_email@example.com
